Just so a youthful rake reflected,
The hero of my current tale:
And mortgaged all the land he could.
Or was he profligate and hale
Of rich rewards and peerless trances;
In pale blue shafts from chimney ends.
His figure in the looking-glass;
A disenchanted opera glass,
Like flighty Venus when she chooses
On top of which, they're so unerring,
Inconstancy grew too fatiguing;
Whatever clever London offers
Until his valet brings his tray.
It has its contradictions, clearly,

And listen for the heart's first beat,
Don't lower your lorgnettes at night!
A little learning means a lot.
Its countless lampions burning bright;
But neither whist, nor gossip there,
Which young Semynova did share;
His double glass he calmly centres
But God, what deadly boredom, brothers,
Each with a different dogma girded;
Do you today devote your song?
And playfully astound the young,
He turned at last and vaguely fluttered
Within his soul must hold men small;
He drives to bed from last night's ball,

And she my willing lips will teach
What vernal flowers do you tread?
Both love's and Petrarch's ardent speech.
Fine china, bronzesall displayed;
Already bored, to uncle's bed,
Onegin was, so some decided
May I present, as we set sail,
And economics he knew well;
To make the foreign tour we'd planned;
Of history's annals full of must,
Still glitter grandly all about;
'Twas this our hero had contracted;
Monsieur l'Abb, a needy fellow,
Perhaps he also dimly knew

I recollect the ocean rumbling:
Unbidden tears and its ovations,
The Latin vogue today is waning,
'My uncle, man of firm convictions . . .
And maddened pangs of love's refrain.
So thus he failed to join the faction
Then read and readfrustration growing:
A lonely boat would sail along,
Or seek some other sweet employment:
'It's time for something new,' he muttered,
So much of life have I neglected
There too, beneath the theatre's tent,
Was quite the pedant in his dress
I spent my days of deepest bliss?

His father ran up debts galore;
Of steady labour made him ill,
Whatever Paris, seeking treasure,
And nothing issued from his quill;
In dancing too his step was light,
The river gay and sparkling bright,
I have of old relied upon
Blind fortune's malice and men's scorn.
To whom amid the jealous throng
Still sleeps on furs at carriage door;
I roam the shore, await fair weather,
Will you at last cut memory's thread?
No cards, no balls, no poets' feats
Are Tasso's octaves' soaring flights.

Eugene stood lost in pensive dreaming
Dared clean his nails in front of him,
And friends and friendship less intriguing;
And how his wicked tongue would gore him!
Onegin's uncle, sick and dying,
And then I'll write this world a song
Those rushing tides in tumult tumbling
That's five and twenty cantos long!
These words are hardly Russian stock;
Became in time our young man's fate,
And quite contented with his fate,
But pantaloons, gilet, and frock
How early he could stir or worry
Where will he dash to, my good hearty?

For country calm and lack of strife;
But found it noxious in the north.
And spleen, he saw, would dog his life,
I too there used to saunter forth,
He enterscork and bottle spout!
Would like to bid his heir adieu.
The thing he'd learned above all arts,
The sum of all our hero's parts,
The droning music never ceases;
Fate watched Eugene in his dependence;
Without a foreword's interference,
The double carriage lamps in rows
No surer place for declarations,
A due respect for his afflictions

We've all received an education
And soon, quite soon, the tempest's core
He lacked, it's true, all predilection
Quite ceased to tempt him any more
But look, Onegin's at the gateway;
And pass him medicines morosely
And soon, quite soon, the tempest's core
But stop ... Enough! My babbling lyre
It has its contradictions, clearly,
Diana's breast is charming, brothers,
May his example profit others;
He gave a ball some three times yearly,
In springtime on the meadow's green,
While muffled by the violin

With vain pursuit of worldly ends;
Perfumes in crystal jars arrayed;
My goddesses! You vanished faces!
And cleared the darkened mind she found.
And driven home to change and preen.
Conceal his hopes, play jealous swain,
For one may be a man of reason
Why argue vainly with the season?
Or go on dropping words of wit
But you, you men in wedded bliss,
No maiden's lips were equal bliss,
The loves and intrigues of the past,
And when across this world I pass
In what grim desert, madman, banished,

Another round would hardly hurt them,
So inaccessibly serene,
Could not conceive how solemn Grimm
The priests and guests left one by one.
The only clever thing he's done.
The hero's named, the plotting's done;
And while the weary band of servants
While all those cupids, devils, serpents
To join the crowd, where each is ready
That, like proud Byron, I have penned
The press intense, the hubbub loud;
To hiss at Phdreso unsteady,
The endless round, the varied game;
Tomorrow too will be the same.

No, nothing touched his sombre heart,
Straight scissors, curved ones, thirty sizes
He noticed nothing, took no part.
Shall once again I hear your chants?
And, presently, induced a snore;
Through Albion's great and haughty lyre
Our sage of eighteen summers' bloom.
All this adorned his dressing room,
And earn me tribute paid to fame:
Released to them the whole estate ...
He did possess the happy forte
Distorted readings, noise, and blame!
A laudable and worthy goal.
In man's attire to pay a call

Or see the Russian muse of dance
Now my Eugene, Chadyev's* double,
At first Madame was in attendance;
From jealous critics fearing trouble,
Of brushes for the modern male
Our lives were weary, flat, and stale;
Amid his feasts to no avail?
Answers the drumbeat's duty call.
This might well seem an indiscretion,
And now she leaps! And now she whirls!
And then the other slowly twirls,
By falling gravely ill, he's won
Eugene, detesting litigation
Enchanted land! There for a season,

Upon the ballroom's mirrored floor,
What from his prime had been his pleasure,
But wearied by the ballroom's clamour,
You too, young mistresses of leisure,
By sylvan shade that lay implanted
Then, wined and dined and heavy-hearted,
From Romulus to Tuesday last.
That sees in sounds life's highest quest,
My hero's features here with mine
Yes, soon he lost all warmth of feeling:
He crammed his bookshelf overflowing,
And recollect a time that's gone?
Have other maidens gained your places,
The wilful swarm of hot desires.

So books, like women, he deserted,
(As once some poet drew himselP).
Just so in carefree song I paid
Upon the crossroads of the sea?
My fleeting, youthful days were spent.
And entertain the nearly dead,
He calls a sleigh as daylight's dimming;
Upon those feet these lips ... caressing.
Of ladies and their modish pets.
But when the age of restless turnings
They're hardly worth the songs one sings
Pour forth their warm and cheerful glows
Of anecdotes of ages past:
For rooting in the ancient dust

Where will he make the night's first call?
I might describe in terms more knowing
Oh, never mindhe'll make them all.
And then I'll write this world a song
Oh, hearken to my woeful call:
Yet not replaced you after all?
That's five and twenty cantos long!
While far away some rousing song
My spirit's own newborn creation!
Along the Petersburg chausse
His former love of life was dead.
All poets, I need hardly mention,
Appear so proud or so forbearing,
With those who'd known the now deceased;

Far from the Rome his heart embraced.
At first he'd beg a declaration,
With men he knew or friends he spied,
Cite Juvenal in conversation, 
Amid his pleasures and their blaze,
No, never midst the fiercest blaze
And over all that dusty crowd
All gone are youth's bright years of grace,
An honest man who'd served sincerely,
The actual things that make it thrive,
How shrewdly he could be inventive
In French he could and did acutely
And mind the beauty of his nails.
When cherished beings filled my dreams.

The quickly summoned, glistening tear!
He found the manor fairly bustling
Brought up in Oriental splendour,
I liked his natural bent for dreaming,
As did derivative Knyazhnin;
We drank in silent contemplation
With passion's game we both were sated;
They laid to rest the dear departed;
Through drawing rooms he'd pass and stare;
Yet were not morals ill affected
Corneille's full genius resurrected;
In racing droshkies bound for pleasure
Half drowsing,
And caped in storms, shall I go questing

Devises to attract the sight,
Then through his dressing room he'll pass
To keep your daughters well in sight;
But all too soon our paths divided,
At masquerade or midnight ball.
And hasten rather to forestall
These clothes and faces with displeasure;
Some raved or lied, and some were dense;
Rousseau (permit me this digression)
One foot upon the ground she places,
In quick succession silhouettes
My spirit's own newborn creation!
The balmy fragrance of the night!
My dear Elvina, I adore it

And honoured patron of the barre
Extinguished ashes won't rekindle,
But meanwhile, dressed for morning pleasure,
Within my soul will fade and dwindle:
The comet wine comes gushing out,
While thoughts of money filled his head.
But now Didelot is boring stuff.'
And yet I'll say on his behalf,
Since, after all, I'm one of them.
I give myself to harmless pleasures
At least three hours he peruses
But now the chime and watch alert them:
Extinguished ashes won't rekindle,
Within my soul will fade and dwindle:

And why for gold it need not strive,
Sweet idleness! You have my heart.
Use flattery as warm incentive,
The sacred ecstasy of art;
The cry resounds: 'Make way! Let's go!'
And more than once, in cotton cap,
So dignified, so awfully smart,
A learned, if pedantic, sort.
Great charm to private conversation;
While Petersburg, already rousing,
Your interest piqued and doubtless growing
Back to our springtime's golden morn.
A London dandy, hair all curled,
A laid-out corpse was what he found,

And bows he'd mastered absolutely.
His only torment, toil, and treasure,
And, oh, how base to pamper grossly
To stroll about at total leisure,
It's sacred to Apollo's choir;
This child of comfort and of glamour,
The emptiness that plagues his soul
He lived, he breathed one single dream,
I pray you, heed my sound advice,
In winter with the hearth before it,
And while the lamps both in and out
As from the meadow your light trace.
Are quite as faithless as their feet.
Where first I loved, where first I wept,

And land of harsh, forbidding places;
And sure enough a note came flying;
I even now would worship balls.
I've drawn a plan and know what's needed,
So rend my soul, so flame my blood.
He draped a linen mourning shroud.
Some mornings still abed he drowses,
But I prefer above these others
Didelot his crown of fame perfected.
Since I dropped sinning long ago.
To put a bullet through his head,
While next to Limburg's lively mould
Who'd ask for more? The world could tell
Which is to say that he could tell

On soft Italian nights I'll go
To crush a rivaloh, what nets,
To fluff the pillows for his head,
But sweeter still, amid such nights,
But if indeed I overborrow,
And I confess (in public sorrow)
And what we called a fop, no less.
To conquer youthful virtue's meekness
The cabby plods to hackney row.
But when he reached his uncle's haven,
To spare his charge excessive pain,
To tend a sick man night and day,
Ah, dearest feet, where have you vanished?
For fate took matters into hand.

While life was still but in its morn
And then await sweet recompense.
And shall I then in silence yawn
Some lacked all conscience; some, all sense;
He takes a single glance to measure
I've drawn a plan and know what's needed,
And beckon to each passing sail.
That he had wit and charm as well.
A lover's secret assignation . . .
The crafty husband fawned and chuckled
His father never understood
I too have gazed in rapt attention
But where his genius proved unfailing,
My tribute to the mountain maid,

The Muse appeared as love was ending
But reading Adam Smith restored him,
He had sufficient Latin training
Where maybe, reader, you began,
As if today, through some restriction,
To wash those sizzling cutlets down;
So pleased with all he had in life:
My fertile fancies spring to life.
And earn me tribute paid to fame:
And there, where southern waves break high,
While thinking under every sigh:
Until Brguet's unsleeping chime
And when Eugene drew my attention,
I too had parted with convention,

Was born beside the Neva's span,
This dreadful ailment's heavy toll;
The daring satirist Fonvizin,
As did the skeptical old fool,
The theatre's full, the boxes glitter;
Or plaintive horn would make us shiver.
Who turns each morning into night.
Eugene and I had both decided
Reminds him that it's dinner time.
A fair Venetian at my side,
Now chatting, now a silent guide,
My present novel's Chapter One.
'I've suffered ballets long enough,
The old was dated through and through,

Description, though, is my profession;
His clothing for the learned set.
The brand new ballet's on in town!
But by the third he couldn't stick it:
So we in fancy then were borne
(Strict judges, not to be derided),
I write ... and want no more embraces;
Ludmila's and Rusln's adherents!
He drives to Nevsky Boulevard,
Through marble entry rushes straightway,
There'll be a ball, a children's party;
What languor when his lips were sealed,
By making his the thoughts of others
The country, love, green fields and flowers,

With no great palaces, no streets,
My present novel's Chapter One.
What fiery art his speech revealed!
An endless bottle of champagne
A word of warning should suffice.
Recall Moi'na ... and rejoice
Then trading bows on every side
It's time to quit this dreary lee
A charming lad, though somewhat wild.
Refreshed the stage with comic joy,
